		<h2>Augest 20,2012</h2>

		</p>
		<ol>

			<li>Bountiful,UT</li>
			<li>Last Chance,CO</li>

			I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
		</p>	
		<blockquote>
			Passing cars,<br/>
			When you can't see,<br/>
			May get you,<br/>
			A glimpse,<br/>
			Of eternity.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			I definitely won't be passing any cars.
		</p>

			My first day of the trip!I can't believe finally got everything packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a Segway,I wasn't able to bring awhole lot with me:
		<ul>	
			<li>cell phone</li>
			<li>iPod</li>
			<li>digital camera</li>
			<li>a protein bar</li>
		</ul>
			Just the essentials.
			As Lao Tzu would have said:
			<q>A journey of a thousand whiles begins with one Segway</q>
